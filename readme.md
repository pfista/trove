### What is trove?
Trove lets you store digital photos, videos, and audio in physical space. Leave an item, and the next person to visit that spot will be able to pick it up in exchange for leaving an item of their own (even money!)


### How does it work?
Trove takes advantage of Bluetooth technology using Estimote Beacons. It connects an external server to a local beacon, turning the beacons into digital boxes.
